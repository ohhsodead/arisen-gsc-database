I always seem to forget one person.\n\nFirst of all, i couldn't add in a name changer, because its gsc. So... Yeah. I don't know how to accomplish such a feat.\nSecond, I don't have a do-heart in yet, the verification doesn't stick between rounds yet, and the custom message is glitchy. Ill change that in due time.\nThird, If you don't like it, don't hate. No, this isn't hard and wasn't hard to make.

So I was trying to come up with ideas for a new gamemode and since I couldn't think of anything, I decided to do this. This gamemode only works on one map, hijacked (for now). I thought about doing it for all maps, but I decided I would let others make their own map! In the Pastebin, you'll see that I have included custom functions for creating your own 'The Floor is Lava' gamemode. If you do not have a good understanding of GSC, please do not ask for me to make you a custom gamemode. These custom functions can be pretty confusing to understand. Their are 7 different 'types' of objects you can place. I will go into detail about each one, and how to set it up below.\n\nTypes:\n\nSpawnBase - spawn a base platform so players can spawn on, and not fall off (this was the most requested feature! sorry it took so long!)\nNewSet - simple set of care packages that you can jump on\nStaircase - pretty easy to understand, a simple set of care packages that ascend in height as you go up\nCheckpoint - a care package that saves your progress\nSidewaysMover - a pair of care packages; one moves, one acts as a platform\nPouncer - a pair of care packages; one waits til you get close to move, one acts as a platform\nGuessingBlocks - a set of care packages; one care package is the true one, while the other 2 are fakes and will teleport you back to the last checkpoint (these are randomized each game)\nTeleporting Blocks - a set of care packages, that changes position at different intervals (between 5 and 15 seconds)\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nv1.0\n-Initial Release\n\nv1.1\n-Fixed bugs\n-Added carrier\n\nv1.2\n-Removed carrier for now\n\nv1.3\n-Added Yemen map edit to source\n-Added SpawnBase() feature\n\nv1.3b\n-Added Carrier Map Edit\n\nv1.4\n-Added new obstacle -> teleporting blocks\n-Fixed terminal script error (PC)\n\nv1.5\n-Added Turbine Map Edit\n-Fixed a bug with the elevator\n\n\nCredits:\ndtx12 & Craig Christ (none of this would have been possible without these 2 guys <3)\nIMCSx - GSC Studio\nItsLollo1000\nxTurntUpLobbies - Idea\nYouViolateMe\nJokerRey\nRaz0rMind\nExelo -- cuz he requested it",

A FFA structured mode and a Team structured mode.\nThe FFA structured mode takes place in the FFA gamemode and players try to get the highest single time.\nThe Team Structured mode takes place in the TDM gamemode and players are assigned into teams and the times of every member of each teams runs are added together. The team with the most time wins.\n\nNote: Latency to the host is felt far more in this gamemode than others (The lower your ping the better) You may gitch around sometimes while on the treadmill if you're not host.\n\nThis mode is now fully supported for Public Match play.\n\nChange Log\nV1.3.0\n1) Fixed a bug in the theme menu where if the player tried to select a theme within a second of the themes options appearing on screen, the intro HUD would stop functioning.\n2) Fixed a bug where an Overflow patch would cause some of the HUD colors to change.\n\n3) Fixed a bug where the treads would become out of sync with each other\n4) Added support for Public Match play\n- If the map selected isn't Carrier the game automatically switches to it\nNote: All players connecting to the game after this happens will not be able to join until the game is back in pre-game lobby.\n- ForceHost is automatically enabled, starting up a game in custom games automatically enables force host upon spawning in as host.\n- If an unsurported game type is loaded, the game ends automatically.\n5) The active timer now displays in a HUD element instead of using the Black ops 2 game timer.\n6) Changes to the rank names from Rank 10 to 14.\n7) Added in Unlocks and high score that are automatically given to players when they spawn in.\n\nKnown bugs\n1) Timer sometimes randomly adds or subtracts .0001 at random and sometimes counts up by .1 instead of in increments of .04.\n2) When the mod has been injected more than once or twice, the Theme Selector sometimes glitches out, forcing you to exit the game via the XMB Screen.\n\nCredits:\nShark - Some Forgefunctions and dependency forge functions.\nHiddenHour - General help and bits of script / Feedback / Answering face-palm worthy questions / Latency testing\nxTurntUpLobbies - Overflow Fix\n\nFuture releases:\n- This is slated for a V2.0 Update sometime before the end of 2017.

Shortly after a 10 second countdown will appear,\nwhen the countdown reaches 1 players are free to move and run to the weapon shed where they\nwill choose from a large selection of 59 different weapons available to them. Whilst this is happening there\nis a 10 second no damage period which prevent players from dying straight away when trying to grab a weapon.\n\nThe objective is to be the last one to survive whether you decide to hunt or\nbe hunted.

You cannot kill michael until you are the last player standing. That's basically it. Also, this game mode works best on Team Deathmatch, but Micahel can also be Manually be chosen by the people in the lobby.

         "Description":"Hey Everyone! I've been working on this Game mode since the summer, but just haven't had the time to release the game mode (But I have been playing it Winky Winky). The game mode is called PaintBall Most of you may have played the normal unmodded-Paintball custom game made famous by VanossGaming and 'The Crew'. But I've decided to re-make the game for the modded community! I've expanded the map and added a few extra twists =D. Keep in mind that this is my first modded gamemode and menu so please expect some bugs and I am open to criticism and advice! I will be updating the gamemode regularly to fix bugs. Hope you all enjoy!!!\n\nRules and how to PLAY:\n\nThe game mode is pretty simple to understand basically it's normal TDM on Rush (ONLY) but you will only be able to play in the arena and outside field. Both teams are not allowed to cross the halfway line (OR DIE) which is represented by the skulls on the mini-map. Each team can use the teleporting flags to enter the outside field. For teams on the 'Allies' they can also teleport to a sniping tower where players can snipe enemies, with snipers found in the mystery box. Players can hold the reload button to open doors that are represented by red care packages.\n\nMenu Is not completely finished for the 'All players menu'\n(in arena) If player jumps from long box diagonally to the other side of halfway mark they will not die\n\nCredits:\n\nMe: Creator of the Modded Gamemode: JuniorChange\nVanossGaming 'The Crew': Creator of the original Un-Modded gamemode\nShark (Doors, Flags, mapedit script, information bar)\nZ0neyDanza (mystery box)\nZeiiken's / Africanized (menu base)\nWho ever made the scrip for the Bunker (can't find the creators name)",

         "Description":"Supported Maps: Nuketown2025(DLC), Grind(DLC1), Frost(DLC4), Standoff, Raid, [NEW]Slums, [NEW]Overflow\n\n\nHowdy, I'd like to introduce you all to my take on a childhood favorite game, Red Light Green Light in Black Ops 2. Hopefully people are still around and will be able to enjoy a new game mode release that will hopefully be fun for everyone. This took me a little time to make as I'm fairly new to scripting, but before this I was enjoying using WaW Modtools and creating various levels that I'm still slowly working on currently.\n\n(3/25/1Cool Man (aka Tustin): NEW UPDATE RELEASED! This new update comes with some gameplay fixes, new powerups, maps, gametypes, etc. For a full rundown look at the update list below. Didn't mean to take this long to release an update, after release I haven't touched it in some time, but now I'm glad to be able to release an update. I'll still be updating this gamemode or the time being, and if you have any suggestions, improvement, or additions you would like to see added, plea don't hesitate to reply below!\n\n____\n\n\nGameplay:\n(If anyone would like to make a proper gameplay video by all means go for it and I'll link it here, until then I'll upload a short video whenever).\n\n____\n\n\nObjective:\nSimple, the point of this game is to be the first person within your group to make it to the finish line. Just like the original game the challenge is to only move on green, and stop on red or any other color that's not green. In this game mode there are extra colors to add variance. Moving during any of these visible colors will also result in a loss for the duration of the game. Dog tags represent potential power ups, these power ups can either help, hurt, or do literally nothing for you. There can only be 1 winner per group, if there are multiple you're put into a mini-arena where you're forced to knife to the death, the last one standing will be the overarching winner.\n\nRacers: You're only allowed to move on Green, if you move on anything else you will get caught, and will be out for the remainder of the game. Pick up power ups (dog tags) to have a chance of changing the current competition, but remember that not every power up will help you. The first one of you to make it to the finish line win that round while the rest of the racers take the loss.\n\nWaiting Line: Those of you in the waiting line are in the process of waiting for the next game, you're spectating the current racers while you wait your turn, nothing more to enjoy.\n\nLosers: Well.. nothing more to say but you suck, the game is over for you and you'll need to wait for a brand new game to be able to participate again.\n\nWinners: Depending on the instance of the game you're in, you're waiting for the rest of the racers to finish their turns, if there are multiple winners at the end of the races you're forced into a mini-arena to knife to the death.\n\n\nJoined late: Sorry, the game is designed to not allow people that joined late to race (also helps prevent people from leaving and rejoining and racing again).\n\n_\n\n\n[NEW] Racers Royale:\nWith this new gametype added within update 1, you now have the ability to race with up to 18 (max) players! This gametype is exclusive to only the disc content map Overflow. Racers Royale features additional exclusive powerups, general changes, and fast-paced color cycles. If you come across any issues please reply as I wasn't able to fully test this gametype yet.\n\n____\n\n\n\nPower-ups List:\n> Royale Powerups: Empowered powerups that have the ability to affect the grabber, and random racers.\n> Lives: Gain the ability to increase your life count. When caught with lives you're given another chance, but frozen in place for 3 seconds.\n> Freeze: Gain the ability to freeze other racers.\n> Quick Feet: Gain the ability to gain additional speed.\n> Slow: Gain the ability to slow other racers.\n> Multi-jump: Gain the ability to multi-jump.\n\n> Vunerability: Gain the ability to make any racer vulnerable for the duration or the race. (No powerup can change this, you will be prone to death for the duration of the round)\n> Blindness: Gain the ability to every other racer.\n> Teleporting: Gain the ability to witch places with a random racer.\n> Teleporting: Gain the ability to teleport a random racer.\n> Ante-up: Every racer gets a throwing knife and no longer has invincibility, BUT you're only allowed to attack during Green Light.\n> Vanish: Every racer is invisible.\n\n> Lives: Gain the ability to decrease your life count. (If you're already at 0, nothing will happen)\n> Blindness: Gain the ability to blind yourself.\n> Freeze: Gain the ability to freeze yourself.\n> Slow: Gain the ability to slow yourself down.\n> Nada: Gain the ability to get absolutely nothing.\n> Setback: Get reset back to the start.\n\n\n\nUpdates: (Sorry I don't have spoilers as far as I can see)\nUpdate 0: Release (2/16/1Cool Man (aka Tustin)\nUpdate 1: Redlight Greenlight - UPDATE 1 - Pastebin.com (3/25/1Cool Man (aka Tustin)\nUpdate 1-1: Fixed issue with player movement not working properly with colors, and spawning issues in Racers Royale for the 2nd position.\n\nPlanned:\n[+] Map variance\n[+] Additional Power ups\n[+] Additional Map Support\n[+] Additional excitement for Racers Royale (Added mechanics)\n[+] Others\n[+] (Let me know what else I should add below!)\n\n____\n\nBugs:\n- Overlapping power ups canceling each other out.\n(Please let me know if you find any below!)\n\n____\n\n\nCredits:\n> EternalHabit & others- GSC Resource thread | Various method and function\n> Matrix - Grabbed build functions from his Dodgeball script\n> Vaskq & Kismeh - Main testers I bothered\n> TheFallen = Overflow fix\n> StonedYoda = Custom error message\n> Anyone else I forgot to mention Sal\n\n____\n\n\nNote:\nYou can change the group size if you're using the source files by changing the value of\n\nLine 35 --- level.PPR\n\n(Default and max size being 4).\nDownload Link\n(Updated: 3/25/1)",

At the moment it is only compatible in GSC Studio by iMCSx (you can find it in the modding tools section).\n\nInformation Regarding Edits\nI don't want to see any edits of this released unless you ask for my permission, however this does not mean you are not allowed to edit this to your liking it just means if you are going to release it then please seek my permission first and provide proof that you have actually done quite a large 'edit' and not just chucked your name on it. Anyway on with the release. However I do not control other peoples decisions and if they are going to disrespect the rules I have laid out concerning these issues then there is nothing I can do about it but it will be highly disappointing and hugely disrespectful to me and anyone who helped in the making of this.\n\nDownload\nThese files are updated every time I make changes to any of them, If there is anything important that I have changed or that you should know about then I will inform you on this thread and in the replies below, you will also need to download all the gsc files.\n\nSharks Zombieland [Game Mode]\n\nHow To Make Custom Maps For Zombieland (Original Thread)\n[Map Edits] Sharks Zombieland\n\n____________________________________\n\nChange Log\n\n15/10/2014 1:43AM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc\n\n- Fixed Player Death Loop Bug\n- Fixed Team Change Issues\n- Split Screeners Auto Kicked As They Cause Issues\n\n15/10/2014 12:38PM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc, functions.gsc\n\n- Fixed Another Player Death Loop\n- Added Zombie Check So People Cant Rejoin as a Human\n- Most Team Setup Issues Fixed\n\n15/10/2014 7:55PM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc, functions.gsc\n\n- Fixed ALL Known Bugs ~ Finally!!!!\n- Fixed Skorpion EVO Unknown Weapon Bug\n- Team Changing Is 100% Working For All Clients Now!\n- Added A Boolean To Decide If Host Can Become First Infected\n\n16/10/2014 3:50PM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc\n\n- Fixed An Issue Causing Game To Freeze\n- Increased Zombiefication Time\n- Removed Game Forfeit Time\n\n16/10/2014 7:51AM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc, functions.gsc\n\n- Added A Boolean Which Spawns Working Bots (level.spawnBots = true/false)\n- Added Support For Split Screeners\n\n16/10/2014 10:22AM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc\n\n- Fixed An Issue Which Caused The Game To Randomly End Even If Humans Are Still Alive!\n\n21/10/2014 11:10PM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc, functions.gsc, menu.gsc, forgefunctions.gsc, mapedits.gsc\n\n- Added Map Creation Function (Explanation Thread Soon)\n- Fixed Apparent 'Freezing' Issue?\n- Tweaked A Couple of Things\n\n26/10/2014 3:04PM\nFiles Edited: forgefunctions.gsc\n\n- Added Option To Make Walls, Grids and Ramps Invisible\n- Message Now Shows Up When You Find A Hidden Teleport Flag\n- Made Interactive Objects More Responsive\n- Fixed Some Minor Bugs\n\n3/1/2015 3:05PM\nFiles Edited: All Files\n\n- Stability Improvements\n- Added Variable To Change Turret Limit & Disable News Bar\n- Tweaked Some Functions\n\n3/8/2015 8:32PM\nFiles Edited: All Files\n\n- More Stability Improvements\n- Added Some Helpful Comments For People Wishing To Change Game Settings\n- Fixed Bug With Buying 2 Mystery Boxes At Once\n- Removed Entity Monitor (Believed To Be Causing Freezing, Thanks To xTurntUpLobbies For Working This Out!)\n- Added New Perk & Attachment, Target Finder & Faster Reload\n- Changed Door Color To Red\n- Added Magma Map Detection (For Map Edits)\n\n4/3/2015 6:36PM\nFiles Edited: main.gsc, forgefunctions.gsc\n\n- More Stability Improvements\n- Fixed Freezing Issue When Hosting Online (Finally)\n- You Can Now Use R3 & R1 To Damage Doors (Zombies)\n- Multiple People Can Damage A Door At Once Now (Zombies)\n\n4/4/2015 9:04AM\nFiles Edited: forgefunctions.gsc. main.gsc, functions.gsc\n\n- Zipline Text Is More Responsive\n- Hold Square Instead Of Press To Use Mystery Box Now\n- Mid-Game Freezing Issue Fixed\n- More Then One Person Can Use A Zipline At Once\n- Turrets Spawn In Front Of You, Not Where You Aim\n\n4/5/2015 10:11PM\nFiles Edited: forgefunctions.gsc. main.gsc, functions.gsc\n\n- Fixed A Problem With Map Edits Causing Freezing\n- Made Teleport Flags More Responsive\n- Fixed An Exploit Where Zombies Could Buy The Mystery Box\n- Zombies Can No Longer Use Turrets (They Will Die & Get A Warning Message)\n- Added New Attachment (ACOG Sight)\n- Made Some Minor Tweaks\n\n18/7/2015 6:03PM\nFiles Edited: forgefunctions.gsc. main.gsc\n\n- Minor Improvements\n- New Forge Function / CreateObject('model', origin, angle) \n\n\nForce Host & Bots\n\n- When In A Game, Go Prone And Press DPAD Right To Toggle Force Host\n- The Only Way To Get Bots Working Is By Using The Boolean 'level.spawnBots' Do Not Add Bots The Normal Way!\n- Gametype MUST Be Team Deathmatch, If Not You May Run Into Issues!\n\n\nShop Controls\n\nDPAD Up - Open Menu\nDPAD Up/Down - Scroll Up/Down\nDPAD Left - Close Menu Anywhere\nX - Select Option\nSquare - Go Back/Exit Menu\n\n\nKnown Bugs\n\n- No Known Bugs\nIf You Find Any Bugs, Please Report Them On The Thread!\n\n\nCredits\nHawkin - Ideas\nLightModzz - Ideas\nItsLollo1000 - Code Thread\nYouViolateMe - The Shop Design + Ideas\nRandoms I Met In Public Games - Testing\nWinter - Testing\nCmKs_4_LiFe - Testing\nSchool - Boring Me So Much That I Work On This\nScaR - Recording The Video + Testing\nObris/Bo - Finding Bugs & Testing\nSource Code - Perk List\ndtx12 - Making This Possible\nAnd Anyone Else That I Missed!\n\n\nEnjoy",

A menu that is aimed at being rogue, radical and targets players who are control freaks. V4.0.0 Public Beta is a completely rebuilt menu with most functions from V3.0.1 getting updated and improved and with the addition of more of them. The menu base allows for a near infinite amount of ways to edit your xp lobby and everything else adjustable with a command.\n\nNew features in V4.0.0 Public Beta\n> Host and fully customize XP lobbies with the highest precision possible of any mod that does xp/unlocks lobbies.\n> Once you have chosen a preset XP lobby or set one up yourself, you can save it and have it auto-setup when you start a new match\n> Whitelist/Blacklist support that supports names and clantags.\n> Improved XP lobby functions, several bugs have been removed from V3.0.1's XP functions.\n> Build custom commands by looping, setting to trigger on or running on all players any command that is usable from the menu.\n> Other players can now use the menu, a feature removed V2.4 but re-added.\n> Command permissions are changeable in-game by the host.\n> A bunch of other stuff ...\n\nHow to use: Press L1 (ADS) and R3 (Melee) to open menu. Use DPAD arrows keys to navigate, press Square (reload) to use an option / add a character to the command line. Read the howtouse.txt (included in the download) for more info.\n\nChange log for V4.0.0 Public beta:\n1) New menu base.\n2) Everything rewritten.\n\nVideo V3.0.0 Shown: (Will update to a V4.0.0 one once I finish that video)\n\n\nDownloads:\nV4.0.0 Public beta Compiled for PC and Console + GSCR:\nNBBXPLobbyV4 Public Beta\n\nV3.0.1 Source + Compiled for PC and Console + GSCR\nNBBXPLobbyV3..1 Full Release [Remasted Edition]\n\nOlder downloads:\nDownload links to all previously released versions can be found in the most recent download in the 'Olderversions.txt'.\nThis has been done to clean up thread and to clear up confusion on what version to download.\n\n\nHaving stability issues on the PS3? Try a differnt EBOOT.BIN, that may be your issue.\nIf you're on DEX and have DLC installed, try this EBOOT: EBOOT\nThat EBOOT loads the SPRX: 'BO2GSCDebuger' and has no recoil and anti-ban.\n\nKnown Bugs: V4.0.0 Public beta\n1) General random XP giving issues:\n- Server Command Overflow sometimes happens to cleints while getting unlocks\n- Sometimes clients who should get xp don't get it.\n2) Some times when other modders join, the ' sl client command received with 1 parameters instead of 3 ' error can be received.\n3) General spelling errors in descriptions, print statements ect.\n\nCredits. For Versions 4.0.0 Public Beta\nNGU's GSC Script lists: General bits of code\nShark: drawtext, drawshader and drawvalue.\nThe people who made the GSC Overflow fix: GSC Overflow fix. ",

         "Description":"- Does not use map shaders, only server text to display map names (mp_raid for ex.).\n- Mapvote only executes on the first round of the match.\n- Players are only allowed to vote if they spawn during prematch, not if they join mid-game.\n- Map automatically changes at the end of killcam.\n- Prone debug binds for exiting level and restarting map.\n\nBugs \n- Players will sometimes spawn in the middle of the map and be unable to move. This usually occurs after the very first map change, but may happen multiple times. It can be fixed by restarting the map.\n\nNotes\n- Tested on a CFW PlayStation 3.\n- Developed using personal tools but the `scripts` directory should compile in GSC Studio.",
